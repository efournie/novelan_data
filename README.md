# Novelan data

This is a python script reading the status of a Novelan heat pump using selenium. I used it to get the main information from my LA 16.1HV, not sre if it would work with other models.

The control unit of the heat pump needs to be on the same local network as the computer running the script, its address is set at the beginning of the script.

With the default settings, the password is left blank so we only need to send return on the login screen.

The status page is as far as I know only available in german.
